# SORTING-VISUALIZER
This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JS. This project sorting visualizer is a very simple UI and it allows the users to select the sort algorithm, select the array size, and speed of the visualization.
#What's inside the website
1.Currently available sorting algorithms- Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quicksort (I will plan to bring more algorithms in action to visualize & more changes).
2.You can change the size of the array
3.You can change the speed of the visualization

We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization.
